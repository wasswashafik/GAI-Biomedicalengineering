# GAI-Biomedicalengineering
Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has emerged as a significant catalyst in the pitch of biomedical engineering (BME), besides deep learning and computer vision, bringing about profound changes in the domains of research, diagnostics, and therapies. This study succinctly summarizes the diverse effects and pivotal significance of GAI within this particular domain. It examines the wide range of applications in various fields, for example, drug discovery, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled genomic data analysis, medical imaging, personalized medicine, and bioengineering. It further highlights the utilization of GAI-driven generative models to accelerate the process of drug development, improve the interpretation of medical images, enable customized treatment plans, and aid in the production of custom-made prosthetics. Nonetheless, this technical progression is not devoid of its obstacles. Matters like the quality of data, the interpretability of outcomes provided by AI, and ethical implications demand thorough examination to be scrutinized. However, within the context of these obstacles, there exists significant potential. The future holds great potential in the arena of neural network improvements, as well as collaborative efforts that bring together skills in AI and BME. The integration of GAI into clinical settings offers new avenues for exploration and development. This study presents a thorough examination that highlights the crucial significance of generative AI within the field of BME while also recognizing the intricate nature and ethical considerations associated with its implementation. Through an examination of these concepts, this study will establish a foundation for a comprehensive comprehension of the dynamic connection between AI innovation and medicinal progress since it has collected recently published literature of GAI, application, considerations, challenges and limitations, review articles, implementation and diffusion models.
